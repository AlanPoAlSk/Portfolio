            <div className="text">
            I am a full stack developer and a tax professional with a diverse and versatile skill set. I recently graduated from Coding Dojo, an intensive and comprehensive coding boot camp that taught me frontend and backend development.

            My skill set includes frontend languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React and Bootstrap or Tailwind for creating responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. On the backend, I am proficient in languages like Python and Java, utilizing frameworks such as Django, Flask, Express, and Spring Boot to build robust and scalable server-side applications. Additionally, I have experience working with databases including MongoDB, SQL, and SQLite, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. 
            I am familiar with various tools such as AWS, Postman, Git and VSCode, enabling seamless development and deployment processes. 

            I have also worked as an Office Manager at CAF ACLI, a fiscal service franchise, where I managed the fiscal operations, trained interns, processed over 1000 applications per quarter, and acted as the main point of contact for the central HQ.
            During Covid I led our team through unprecedented times, managing fiscal operations under significant pressure. Despite the challenges, our office not only persevered but thrived, witnessing a remarkable increase in earnings compared to the period preceding my tenure. Notably, our company experienced substantial growth, outpacing many competitors in the industry. This success underscores my ability to thrive in high pressure environments, drive operational efficiency, and contribute to the overall growth and success of an organization.
            I have a strong background in customer service, organization, and problem solving, as well as a proficiency in Italian, Spanish, and English languages.

            I am passionate about technology and eager to apply and test my knowledge, contribute to others' projects, and further my growth within a collaborative team. I have experience working remotely with other developers from different locations, and I have successfully created full-stack CRUD applications in under 5 hours. I am dedicated, adaptable, and curious, and I thrive in the always-updating world of software development.
